    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Florida State University, Northwestern University</p>

    <h2>What sparked my interest in Programming</h2>
    <p> My interest in programming came from when I was in college. While at FSU, the football program introduced me to analytics. Jimbo fisher which is the head football at the Florida State University hired a rocket scientist named Chris Jacobs. Chris implemented GPS systems which tracked every movement a player would make in practice and the weight rooom. The data sets that were created from the gps systems cut down on injuries significantly and the data was able to give the coaches a proven formula that enabled the coaching staff/trainers to hold players out of practice because of fatigue.
